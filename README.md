# AEP_Project

A repository which contains the yocto layer which contains all of the recipes and source files created for the final project required for the Advanced Embedded Programming course held by the *Atelierul de Programatori Google*.

It is a system supervision and control software for the raspberry pi which allows the user to control a virtual DC motor through a REST server and monitor it's speed in real time. It is entirely written in C and makes use of the [facil.io](http://facil.io/) and [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) libraries.
